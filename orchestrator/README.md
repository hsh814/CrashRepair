## Orchestrator Module

The orchestrator provides a simple command-line front-end for CrashRepair which integrates its analysis, repair, and fuzzing modules.

## Usage

The orchestrator is bundled as a standalone executable, `crashrepair`, in the all-in-one Docker image for CrashRepair.
To run the orchestrator on a given bug scenario, you should execute the following:

```
crashrepair repair bug.json
```

where `bug.json` points to the bug.json file for the bug scenario.
Details on the format of `bug.json` are provided below.

Note that the following options can be passed to the `repair` command above:

* `--no-fuzzing`: disables the use of the concentrated fuzzer to create additional test cases for patch validation
* `--stop-early`: instructs CrashRepair to stop running as soon as the first plausible patch has been discovered.
  A plausible patch is one that passes both the proof-of-crash and all of the additional fuzzer-generated tests.
  If this option is not enabled, CrashRepair will produce as many repairs until either it has reached a resource limit (e.g., wall-clock time, number of patches) or all candidate repairs have been exhausted.

For a more complete and up-to-date list of command-line options, use `--help`:

```
crashrepair repair --help
```


## `bug.json` File Format

Below is an example of a `bug.json` file, taken from the `buffer-overflow/dynamic-array` test program:

```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "buffer-overflow"
  },
  "name": "dynamic-array",
  "binary": "src/test",
  "crash": {
    "command": "$POC",
    "input": "./exploit",
    "extra-klee-flags": ""
  },
  "source-directory": "src",
  "build": {
    "directory": "src",
    "binary": "test",
    "commands": {
      "prebuild": "exit 0",
      "clean": "make clean",
      "build": "make"
    }
  }
}
```

* The `crash` section is used to provide the CrashRepair analyzer with the necessary information to diagnose the crash and produce an annotated fix localization. **(FIXME: resolve ambiguity between file-based and argument-based inputs.)**
  * The optional `extra-klee-flags` property is used to inject additional KLEE flags, given as a string, at link time when the analyzer rebuilds the program.
    In all cases, `--link-llvm-lib=/CrashRepair/lib/libcrepair_proxy.bca` will always be injected as a KLEE flag.
